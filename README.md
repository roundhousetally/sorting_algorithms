 # 0x17 - C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
Task # | Short Description
-------|------------
[Task 0](0-bubble_sort.c) | Bubble Sort - Prints array after each time you swap two elements
[Task 0 Quiz](0-O) | Big O notations of the time complexity of bubble sort. Best, average, worst case.
[Task 1](1-insertion_sort_list.c) | Insertion sort - Prints array after each swap. 
[Task 1 Quiz](1-0) | Big O notations of the time complexity of insertion sort. Best, average, worst case.
[Task 2](2-selection_sort.c) | Selection sort - Prints array after each swap.
[Task 2 Quiz](2-0) | Big O notations of the time complexity of selection sort. Best, average, worst case. 
[Task 3](3-quick_sort.c) | Quick sort - Implements `Lomuto` partition scheme. The pivot should always be the last element of the partition being sorted.
